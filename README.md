üåø How the Waste Management System Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Registration and Login
  Users create an account or log in using their credentials.
  Authentication ensures secure access to the platform.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Waste Image Upload
  After logging in, users can upload images of their waste.
  The uploaded image is sent to an AI model (hosted on port 5000) for classification.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Waste Classification
  The AI model processes the image and predicts the waste category ‚Äî for example:
  Organic (food scraps, garden waste)
  Recyclable (plastic, paper, glass)
  Hazardous (batteries, chemicals)
  General waste (non-recyclable items)
  The predicted waste type is displayed to the user.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Waste Amount Entry
  The user manually enters the weight or quantity of the identified waste.
  Clicking the OK button submits both the waste type and amount to the database.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage
  The backend (Node.js + Express) stores this information in a MongoDB database.
  Each record contains:
  User ID
  Waste type
  Waste amount
  Timestamp
6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization
  Users can view their waste history and trends using interactive charts.
  The charts show:
  Daily/weekly waste generation
  Waste type distribution
  Progress toward reducing waste
7Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendations and Reminders
  The system provides personalized tips to reduce waste.
  Users receive notifications/reminders about eco-friendly habits.
